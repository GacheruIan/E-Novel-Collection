      <h1><u>E-Novel Collection.</u></h1>
      
      <p>
        Due to the high rise in tech, the society is loosing the need to reading
        novels and the hobby is slowly fading away day by day, book clubs are
        diminishing on a day to day basis resulting to the difficulty in finding
        novels of any interest.
      </p>

      <h3><u>Solution.</u></h3>

      <p>
        To create a handy solution that can bring novel reading back to its
        current life-style, render a display of novels to search through any
        novel of interest that you can look into later on and also add any novel
        you found interesting for others to go and look into.
